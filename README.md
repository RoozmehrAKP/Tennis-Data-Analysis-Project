# 🎾 Tennis Data Analysis  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project analyzes professional tennis matches using data science techniques. We explore match outcomes, player performance, and trends across different tournament surfaces.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of multiple tables covering:  
- Match details  
- Player statistics  
- Tournament types  
- Scoring data
